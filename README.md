JavaScript Koans is an interactive learning environment that uses failing tests to introduce students to aspects of JavaScript in a logical sequence. These problems will be very simple, so don't overthink them! In most cases the solution is in the question itself. This is about practice and exposure. This should be practiced regularly, in fact you will given this assignment a number of times.

## Running the koans

1. Copy the contents of `koans.js` into a file in your own repository.
2. `npm install ava`
3. `ava koans.js` to run your koans. **The tests should not pass when you're getting started**.

Start editing `koans.js`. You only need replace instances of `__` in each test case to make it pass. You shouldn't need to edit any other code.
